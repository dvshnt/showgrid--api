these are all the api/website scrapers..



###notes:###
1. I found out that facebook limits its search discovery functionality, in order to get facebook data for a venue its a good idea to already have the venue in the database and use a filler.
2. jambase has a 50 query per day limit, keep in mind.



###suggestions:###
add google place search for new venue discovery.
